/**
 * Enemy definitions.
 *
 * §11 asks for "one enemy system with configurable behaviors rather than a
 * bespoke class per creature", so an enemy is a row in this table plus, later,
 * a sprite. Adding the rats, geese, chipmunks and cats means adding entries
 * here — not new classes.
 *
 * The behaviour kinds named in §11 are patrol, dive, chase, emerge-on-timer and
 * thief. Milestone 2 implements the first two; the rest land with the worlds
 * that need them.
